# HiGold: A Decentralized Organization for Blockchain Entertainments

### Abstract

With bitcoin price reaching to nearly $20,000 over the past nine years, people are getting more and more familiar with blockchain. As the first application of blockchain technology, crypto currency has become a potential threat to the financial industry and has brought big challenge to government regulation. However, for most of people, it is difficult to understand the blockchain technology and ideology behind the cryptocurrency, and only very few people can acknowledge the great significance of this decentralization wave.

Most of the people in blockchain industry are only interested in the speculative nature of cryptocurrency, consuming a lot of time and energy in the zero-sum game. Therefore, we hope to build a brand-new blockchain entertainment ecosystem, which will enable people to explore more fun through various blockchain entertainment applications. In the ecosystem, participants are able to apply the blockchain function directly and thereby experience the ultimate charm.

### 1.Community Development
During the preparation of HiGold Community, we don't want to introduce too many crypto-currency speculators in early days. Instead, we hope the community can maintain the operation through traditional online donation. An ERC20Token based on ETH has been created as a community integration system to promote community ecosystem construction and block chain development. Community member will get credits as a reward according to their contribution through Give & Take Plan from time to time.

HiGold Community expects to build a brand new ecosystem together with blockchain fans, which is dedicated to develop a new blockchain project suitable for entertainment applications. It will also serve as an incubator to help community members promote their blockchain projects.

#### TOKEN
The token issued by our community is called HiGold (HIG) and the total number is 21 billion. Half of the token will be reserved for mining after the main chain is developed, while the other half will be converted into new currency at 1:1 after the main chain is launched.

50% of the token will be reserved for mining in the future; 5% allocated to round 1 of the Give & Take Plan; 10% to round 2 and 3 respectively; 10% for community operation; the remaining 15% to HiGold Team with lockup period for 5 years and 1/5 unlock every year.

HiGold（HIG）will serve as the credit to be used in HiGold Community with all the applications, games and services priced by HIG. Community members can obtain certain amount of HIG through community service and/or donation and then use it inside the community as they wish.

#### DONATION
The operation of HiGold Community will rely on the donation of community members, with only ETH and HIG or token acceptable. We have only one collecting address, namely: 0xcddede7f0b57225cf22bc61d53bc5a14734f36ec

All donation will be obtained for community operation, main chain development and the market value management of HIG. We will implement the Give&Take Plan from time to time and reward our donors with honor or community token.

#### Give&Take Plan
We will launch an incentive plan to generous donors and reward them with community credits. In the early stages of community development, we’ve set up a three-phase donation incentive plan. The first phase of the program will distribute 1.05 billion HIG to the donors, while the second and third phase to allocate 2.1 billion HIG respectively. In each phase of the incentive plan, the community will also distribute additional benefits to prominent donors, all of which, to be fair, will be considered based on the donation amount and the order of precedence.

### 2.Vision of Main Chain
In 2008, the concept of block chain was first proposed by professor Nakamoto. Block chain is a new application model for computer technologies such as distributed data storage, peer to peer communication, consensus mechanism and encryption algorithm. its essence is a decentralized distributed ledger and the purpose is to resolve the problem of trust during transaction. The blockchain has six characteristics: decentralization, reliability, openness, autonomy, untamperability and anonymity. We hope to exploit these features to develop a HiGold blockchain which is more suitable for video game entertainment. The development of HiGold main chain is the main mission of HiGold community. Here we only express the future vision of HiGold blockchain, while all mainchain technical details will be clarified in our technical white paper.

#### Virtual Property
For traditional online game, players have no virtual ownership of the personal information provided to operators and the game characters and virtual items within their accounts. All this is firmly controlled by game companies through a variety of terms of service, meaning that all virtual products created in the game are possessed by those companies and the players have no right to transfer them freely. We hope that through blockchain technology, game players’ ownership of virtual asset will be recorded on the blockchain so that they can freely store and transfer their own virtual assets.

#### Random Number
Random Number technique is widely used in computer applications and is best known for their applications in cryptography. In blockchain technology, random number is the top priority of private key security, while in the game industry, random Number is the key to the enjoyment, fairness and security. Our mainchain will become a decentralized random number generator, providing a reliable and fair random number for related games. Any person's behavior on the blockchain would result in a random number change, yet no one can control the result. We will draw on experience from existing project technology and thereby design the generation mechanism of mainchain random number to defend against "random number generator attacks".

#### Onchain Game
The special features of blockchain make it a good carrier for some games, such as gambling and card games. At the beginning of HiGold mainchain development, we hope that anyone can easily deploy some simple games, and gambling and card games would be the best choice because they don't need too much computation and data storage. Any game deployed on the blockchain can easily achieve the "provable fairness". All players’ chips number is transparent and can be traded immediately, which avoids the cheating or fraud from any party.

#### HiGold Platform
We hope to build the mainchain into a blockchain version of digital distribution platform, providing digital rights management, game interaction, virtual asset trading and other functions. Users can release, install and update the game on HiGold blockchain platform and all the game accounts, characters and virtual items can be stored, transferred and traded on the blockchain. Game developers can integrate HiGold platform into their own products and even deploy the game on the blockchain.

### 4.Project Incubation
Guiding the traditional game entertainment industry to embrace the blockchain is another important mission of HiGold community. We are willing to hatch eligible blockchain projects and provide fund, technology, management and other support at the early stage, promote cooperation and communication between the project party and the community and community members, so as to reach final success and multi-win situation.

#### Financing Service
As a "platform" for investment and financing, HiGold Community would select eligible blockchain projects and design reasonable financing plan according to its own situation. For high-quality projects, community members have priority for investment opportunities and The community will provide objective advice in order to improve the success rate. After a successful project financing, the community will also supervise its financial management.

#### Technical Consultation
In the process of blockchain development and project incubation, the knowledge and technology accumulation of the blockchain technology will be acquired, which is critical and valuable to HiGold Community, and we are happy to share it with community members. The blockchain projects incubated by the community can get technical advice and support for sure.

#### Resource Sharing
There can be no systematic and comprehensive resource allocation for a startup project. HiGold Community is willing to provide advice and help for the operation and management of incubated projects and share community resources. This enables the startup project to maximize cost savings, utilize community resources efficiently and grow rapidly.

### 5.Market Value Management
Although HiGold (HIG) is just a community integration and circulate within the community, but as a product of digital currency movements, it will also compete with other digital currency and market value is crucial in this competition. The community will establish a favorable market value management mechanism, strengthen core competitiveness and choose the best competition strategy.

#### Information Disclosure
HiGold team will build different communication channels with community members through social media and disclose important matters timely and fully, with authenticity, integrality and accuracy as our principle. We will establish a regular reporting system to update the progress of community projects in a timely manner. We hope to build a perfect information disclosure system and do our best to assure community members’ interests and rights to know.

#### Team Incentive
Any successful blockchain project can't be separated from a stable core team and a 15 percent HIG share will be allocated to the core team. This portion will be locked for five years and only 20% unlocked each year. We hope to use this as a link to enhance the core team's impulse to create value and maximize the interest of the whole community.

#### Buy-back Machanism
Share buyback refers to the behavior of a listed company to purchase a certain amount of shares issued by its own from the stock market by cash or other means. In order to protect the interests of community members, we also hope to establish a similar mechanism. When the market is undervalued, our community operation team will buy back a certain amount of HIG to maintain the reasonable HIG valuation. The buyback method is unlimited while all the buyback HIG is used for community operation.
